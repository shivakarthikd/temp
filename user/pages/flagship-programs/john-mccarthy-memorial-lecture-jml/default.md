# John McCarthy Memorial Lecture
Dear Members,

Greetings from Chapter Chair. I am pleased to invite you to the Fourth John McCarthy Memorial Lecture  (JML-2019)  hosted by CIS/GRSS Jt. Chapter, IEEE Hyderabad Section. This year the lecture will be delivered by **Prof. M. Vidyasagar, Fellow, IEEE.**  

**Date/ Time : 14-Nov-2019 / Thursday/ 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM**

**Venue : Hotel Plaza, Begumpet, Hyderabad.**

***Title: Artificial Intelligence: An Unfinished Revolution***


**Abstract:** <p align="justify"> The current excitement about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is at least the third in a cycle of hype followed by disillusionment.  In earlier cycles, those methods that had a solid mathematical foundation has survived, while others have faded away.  In the current cycle, at least some members of the research community have begun to recognize the need for foundational analysis of currently popular methods such as deep learning.  This talk presents an overview of recent successes as well  as challenges for the future, to ensure that the current enthusiasm for AI does not lead to disillusionment and despair.

***Brief Biographical Sketch:*** <p align="justify"> M. Vidyasagar received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin in 1969.  During his fifty-year career, he has received numerous awards in recognition of his research, including Fellowship of The Royal Society, and the IEEE Control Systems Technical Field Award.  He is the author of thirteen books and more than 150 papers in refereed journals.  At present, he is a SERB Distinguished Fellow and Distinguished Professor at IIT Hyderabad.

**About  John McCarthy**
<p align="justify">
John McCarthy, was an American computer scientist pioneer and inventor, was known as the father of Artificial Intelligence (AI) after playing a seminal role in defining the field devoted to the development of intelligent machines. He coined the term "artificial intelligence" (AI), developed the LISP programming language family, significantly influenced the design of the ALGOL programming language, popularized timesharing, and was very influential in the early development of AI. Programs written in LISP have flown in a NASA spacecraft and are key parts of several practical AI systems. "John's accomplishments, his many publications, and his prescient insights earned him many awards. Among these are the ACM Turing Award, the National Medal of Science, the Kyoto Prize, and memberships in the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of Engineering. (Source Wikipedia)
