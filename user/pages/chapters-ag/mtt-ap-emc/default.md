MTT is a welcoming, global community of scientists and engineers engaged in research and development of the RF, microwave, mm-wave and THz technologies. These are critical enablers of a wide range of wireless-based applications, including 5G systems, sensor systems, and the Internet of Things. The Society’s flagship conference, the International Microwave Symposium, is the world’s leading event in the field and is a “must-attend” opportunity to hear outstanding technical presentations combined with a large industry exhibition. MTT has a strong volunteer ethos and its Chapters offer excellent opportunities for personal career development, networking, as well as for acquiring new knowledge.

APS provides members affordable access to cutting-edge technical information covering antenna systems and electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering in complex media for wireless communication, sensing, medical, and other applications. Membership includes access to multiple periodicals, including magazines, reduced conference registration rates, and members-only content on the AP-S website.

EMC is the world's largest organization dedicated to the development and distribution of information, tools, and techniques for reducing electromagnetic interference. Membership includes access to multiple periodicals, networking opportunities, and discounts to EMC's Annual Symposia.
