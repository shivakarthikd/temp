## About
---

IEEE CIS/GRSS Chapter Hyderabad is a vibrant group having members from both Industry and academia with sole mission of promoting computational Intelligence technologies that are of societal importance and benefit the Human kind. In the recent years we have seen a phenomenal growth in value driven businesses and mobile platforms that provide valuable user centric services to individuals. On the other hand advances in Geoscience and Remote sensing has transformed our understanding of the earth, oceans, atmosphere, and space systems through improved processing and interpretation. Many of the outcomes are being utilized for societal benefits. The continious collections of data from multiple variety of sensors from multiple satellites is resulting in large volumes of data. The challenges associated with processing and understanding is presently of wide interests to industry, research organizations and academia. The current focus of the Industry is to develop systems that can learn, behave in an intelligent manner to maximize their automation, the growth in utilization of remote sensing data there is huge scope and potential in the growth of CI technologies. The main goal of the chapter is to bring together professionals from academia and Industry to share their research findings on these frontiers. Also, one of our objectives is to harness the skills of young professionals and students through their involvement in the chapter activities. Volunteers are the veins of the chapter, so we are in continuous look out for strong self motivated individuals to volunteer and steer the chapter to realize its vision. We welcome your suggestions and participations in our activities.

## History
---

The Chapter was founded in 2011 by Dr. Amit Kumar. Dr. Amit Kumar chaired the chapter from 2011-2012. The chapter under his leadership received the outstanding CIS chapter award in 2013. Prof. Atul Negi chaired the chapter from 2013 to 2015. The present chair Dr. Naresh Kumar is steering the chapter from 2016 onwards. Under his leadership a computational intelligence, Geoscience and Remote Sensing societies joint chapter was envisaged and formed in 2017. His outstanding contributions as volunteer has won accolades from CIS resulting in yet another outstanding CIS chapter award for actitivites done in 2016.

## Activities  
---

IEEE CIS chapter Hyderabad Section has organized more than 25 events this year. We have organized hands on sessions, technical talks, workshops with experts from premier academic institutions and Industry such as Indian Statistical Institute kolkota, PES University, Mahindra ecole Centrale, Infosys and Microsoft. Recently, we have organized a flagship event titled “John Mc Carthy Memorial Lectures series” which is widely accepted by the CIS community. The first lecture was delivered by Prof. C.A. Murthy, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and the Second lecture was delivered by Prof. Raghu Krishnapuram, Fellow IEEE. Recently, we have started GRSS flagship event titled "Richard Moore Memorial Lectures". The first lecture was delivered Dr. Paul A. Rosen, JPL, NASA. We propose to take forward our experiential learning to organize innovative programs that provide oppurtunities for all classes our memberships in 2018.

## Pre-College Materials
---

The CIS Pre-College Activities Subcommittee has prepared some CI-related introductory materials, which may be helpful for you to promote your activities for pre-college students and industry members. There are two packages, including the Artificial Neural Networks pack and Fuzzy Logic pack. You can find more details below:

### Artificial Neural Networks pack comprises of:
An interactive power point presentation which examines how we learn using our brain and examines, what exactly is an artificial neural network
A basic introduction to how an artificial neural network learns.
Introduction to a simple Eyeball Neural Network and associated activity- how does the network learn to detect apples?
A hands-on classroom activity where you get to identify features and classify items in a bag.
