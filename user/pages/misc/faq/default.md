---

1. Login to your GiHub account. Please create one at https://github.com  
2. Select the ieeehyd-website/2018 repo.  
Now go to https://github.com/ieeehyd-website/2018  
**Fork the ieeehyd-website/2018 repo:**  
3. Click on 'fork' located in the top-right corner.  
It means you will have a copy of the website repo into your own account.  
4. IF it says you cant't fork - if you have already the website repo in your account.  
Now you can rename or delete the repo in your account.  
Again attempt the Step 3 (Forking the website repo).  
Time taken to Steps 3 or 4 will be around 5 minutes or less. All you can do in your browser.  
**Now you clone or edit the FORKED repo (NOT the ieeehyd-website/2018)**  
If you are using Atom, Visual Code or any other tools of your choice.
I recommend to use Visual Code from Microsoft. It is a great development environment. 
Of course, you can use Atom or any other tool of your choice.
5. git clone <your forked repo>  
6. Add / Modify your content. Please do use the folder that is relevant to your chapter.  
Technically, nothing prevents from adding/modifying content in the repo, please just use your chapter folders for easy merging.  
**Git Commit and Push the changes**  
7. Once you are done with your content modifications (files / folders), please commit and push the changes to your forked repo only. Usually, if you use Visual Code / Atom, it will prompt for userid <give your github account> and <password>.  
Now your changes are in your forked repo. You can check in the GitHub Account  
Time taken for the Step 7: 5 minutes. Just login and go to your forked repo an verify the changes.  
**All set to create a PULL Request.**    
8. Create a pull request.  
**Merging the PULL request**  
9. The Pull request reaches the Admin of ** ieeehyd-website/2018 **  
10. Admin will merge the changes into main branch. If there are some issues, the pull request will be rejected.  
**What if the PULL request is rejected?**  
11. IF PULL Request is Rejected.. Go to the Step Step 5 and Follow the steps. In some cases, you have to fork again. This is one of the reasons, please limit your changes to your chapter folder only.  
**Publishing the content on to the Web**  
12. Admin will build the changes and pushes to web hosting.
