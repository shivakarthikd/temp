<p class="text-center lead">
The IEEE Hyderabad Section is one of the most active sections of IEEE in India. IEEE was formally introduced in Hyderabad, in June 1981, when a group of engineers in Hyderabad decided to form an IEEE sub-section here. This sub-section was rapidly elevated to a full section, in 1984 (the year of IEEE Centenary celebrations). All IEEE members residing in the states of Telangana, India and Andhra Pradesh, India are automatically members of the IEEE Hyderabad Section.
