  The IEEE Hyderabad Section is one of the most active sections of IEEE in India.
  IEEE was formally introduced in Hyderabad, in June 1981, when a group of engineers
  in Hyderabad decided to form an IEEE sub-section here. This sub-section was rapidly 
  elevated to a full section, in 1984 (the year of IEEE Centenary celebrations).
